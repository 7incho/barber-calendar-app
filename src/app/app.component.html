      Angular is my favorite framework, and this is why. Angular has the coolest
      deferrable view feature that makes defer loading content the easiest and
      most ergonomic it could possibly be. The Angular community is also filled
      with amazing contributors and experts that create excellent content. The
      community is welcoming and friendly, and it realty is the best community
      out there.
